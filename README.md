# Background

Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from
a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

Data hails from [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The Questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying
   jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
